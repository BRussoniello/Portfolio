# Survival Analysis in the Presence of Competing Risks

This paper served as the final project for the course STA5198 - Epidemiology for Statisticians. In this paper, I reviewed some of the current methodology available for the
analysis of survival data in the presence of competing risks. These methods have been drawn from textbooks and journal articles published in the past 20 years. I demonstrated the use of these methods with hypothetical scenarios of made up data, and modelling of data drawn from a real data set.
