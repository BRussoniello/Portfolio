# Portfolio

The purpose of this repository is to host school projects that have helped me to develop my competency in various areas of Statistics. 

# Survival Analysis in the Presence of Competing Risks

This paper served as the final project for the course STA5198 - Epidemiology for Statisticians. In this paper, I reviewed some of the current methodology available for the
analysis of survival data in the presence of competing risks. I demonstrated the use of these methods with hypothetical scenarios of made up data, and modelling of data drawn from a real data set.

# Using Demographic and Survey Data to Predict Student Performance

This paper served as the final project for the course STA5167 - Statistics in Applications II. In this project, David Smith (Florida State University) and I examined data from a Portuguese secondary school mathematics course and explored  several factors  that  are  meaningful  to  student  performance. Our goal was to create a practical and interpretable model that could be used by educators and government officials to find students at risk of performing poorly. 

# A Transcriptome Wide Association Study in Conjunction With Fine-mapping Identifies Four Potentially Causal Genes For Neuroticism

This paper served as the final project for the course STA5934 - Statistical Genetics. In this paper, Hunter Melton (Florida State University) and I conducted a TWAS and Fine-mapping to identify genes that explained the association signal of genes and presence of neuroticism in European subjects. Further details of the analysis conducted can be found at https://github.com/BRussoniello/Statistical-Genetics-Project
